## Key System Components

### API Layer
The primary interface for all system interactions:
- **RESTful endpoints** for all business operations
- **Authentication gateway** validating all requests
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Request/response logging** for audit trails

### Authentication Service
Handles all identity and access management:
- **User authentication** via email/password or OAuth
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for authorization
- **Session management** with JWT tokens
- **Multi-factor authentication** support

### Business Logic Layer
Core domain services implementing business rules:
- **Vehicle management** services
- **Partner services** orchestration
- **Checklist processing** engines
- **Quote management** workflows
- **Collection scheduling** algorithms

### Data Persistence
Reliable storage for all system data:
- **Relational database** for structured data
- **Object storage** for files and media
- **Caching layer** for performance optimization
- **Backup and recovery** mechanisms

### Notification Service
Real-time communication with stakeholders:
- **Email notifications** for status updates
- **SMS alerts** for critical events
- **Push notifications** for mobile users
- **Webhook integrations** for external systems

## External Integrations

### Parts Suppliers
Integration with supplier systems for:
- **Inventory lookup** and availability checking
- **Order placement** and tracking
- **Pricing updates** and promotions
- **Delivery status** synchronization

### Insurance Companies
Data exchange with insurance providers:
- **Claims processing** automation
- **Vehicle history** sharing
- **Damage assessment** collaboration
- **Repair authorization** workflows

### Government Systems
Compliance with regulatory requirements:
- **Vehicle registration** verification
- **Safety inspection** reporting
- **Environmental compliance** tracking
- **Tax and fee** calculation

## Security Architecture

### Identity and Access Management
- **Multi-tenant isolation** with role-based permissions
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive data
- **Audit logging** for all system activities
- **Compliance monitoring** for regulatory requirements

### Network Security
- **Firewall protection** at perimeter boundaries
- **Intrusion detection** systems monitoring traffic
- **DDoS protection** for service availability
- **Secure API gateways** with rate limiting

### Data Protection
- **Database encryption** at rest and in transit
- **PII anonymization** for analytics processing
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing
- **Incident response** procedures for breaches

## Scalability Architecture

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Load-balanced API** endpoints for request distribution
- **Database sharding** for data distribution
- **Microservices architecture** for independent scaling
- **Auto-scaling groups** for variable demand

### Performance Optimization
- **Content delivery networks** for static assets
- **Database indexing** for query optimization
- **Caching strategies** at multiple layers
- **Asynchronous processing** for heavy operations

### Fault Tolerance
- **Redundant infrastructure** across availability zones
- **Automated failover** for critical services
- **Data replication** for disaster recovery
- **Health monitoring** with alerting systems

## Deployment Architecture

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Containerized services** using Docker/Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code** for consistent deployment
- **Continuous integration/deployment** pipelines
- **Environment parity** across dev/staging/production

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Application performance monitoring** (APM)
- **Infrastructure monitoring** with metrics and alerts
- **Distributed tracing** for request tracking
- **Centralized logging** for debugging and audit

## Evolution Roadmap

### Current State
- **Monolithic core** with microservices extensions
- **Single-region deployment** with backup capabilities
- **Manual scaling** with basic monitoring
- **Hybrid authentication** (session and token-based)

### Near Term Goals (6-12 months)
- **Full microservices migration**
- **Multi-region deployment** for high availability
- **Advanced monitoring** with AI-powered insights
- **Enhanced security** with zero-trust architecture

### Long Term Vision (1-2 years)
- **Serverless functions** for event-driven processing
- **Global edge computing** for reduced latency
- **Self-healing systems** with automated remediation
- **Predictive analytics** for proactive service management
