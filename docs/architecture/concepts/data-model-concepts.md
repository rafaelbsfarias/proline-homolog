# Conceptual Data Modeling

This document provides a high-level overview of the data modeling approach used in the ProLine Hub system, focusing on core entities and their relationships.

## Core Domain Entities

### Vehicle-Centric Model
The ProLine Hub system is fundamentally centered around vehicles, with all other entities relating to specific vehicles through various workflows and processes.

```
Vehicle
  │
  ├── Service Order
  │     │
  │     ├── Inspection
  │     │     │
  │     │     └── Specialist Checklist
  │     │
  │     └── Quote
  │           │
  │           └── Partner Checklist
  │
  └── Collection
        │
        └── Timeline Events
```

### Partner Ecosystem
Partners form a diverse ecosystem of service providers, each with their own specializations and capabilities within the platform.

```
Partner
  │
  ├── Services Catalog
  │     │
  │     └── Specializations
  │
  ├── Quotes
  │     │
  │     ├── Checklists
  │     │     │
  │     │     ├── Items
  │     │     ├── Evidences
  │     │     └── Part Requests
  │     │
  │     └── Service Orders
  │
  └── Reviews
```

## Workflow Integration Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
Many business processes follow a sequential pattern where completion of one phase triggers the next:

```
Vehicle Registration → Collection Scheduling → Inspection → 
Quote Generation → Service Approval → Execution → Completion
```

### Parallel Workflow
Some processes can happen in parallel, particularly when multiple partners are involved:

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   Quote 1   │
                    └─────────────┘
                          │
Vehicle ─── Inspection ─┼─────────────┐
                          │           │
                    ┌─────────────┐   │
                    │   Quote 2   │   │
                    └─────────────┘   │
                          │           │
                    ┌─────────────┐   │
                    │   Quote 3   │   │
                    └─────────────┘   │
                          │           │
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │ Service Order   │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

## Data Ownership and Isolation

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
Each client organization maintains complete data isolation through schema separation, ensuring no cross-contamination between tenants.

### Partner Data Boundaries
Partners can only access data related to their own quotes, checklists, and services, with strict enforcement at both API and database levels.

### User Role Permissions
Access control is implemented through role-based permissions, with different levels of access for:
- Clients (vehicle owners)
- Partners (service providers)
- Specialists (inspection experts)
- Administrators (system operators)

## Temporal Data Management

### Event Sourcing Pattern
Key business events are captured as immutable records, enabling comprehensive audit trails and historical analysis.

### Snapshot Strategy
Periodic snapshots of complex aggregate states are maintained for performance optimization while preserving event history.

### Timeline Consistency
All temporal data is coordinated through a unified timeline that provides a chronological view of vehicle history.

## Relationship Patterns

### One-to-Many Relationships
Common pattern for hierarchical data where one entity owns multiple child entities:
- One vehicle has many service orders
- One service order has many quotes
- One quote has one checklist

### Many-to-Many Relationships
Used for associative data where entities relate to each other in flexible ways:
- Partners to service categories
- Vehicles to timeline events
- Users to roles

### Self-Referencing Relationships
Hierarchical structures where entities can reference other instances of the same type:
- Parent-child vehicle relationships
- Quote revision chains
- Service dependency trees

## Data Lifecycle Management

### Creation Phase
Entities are initially created with minimal required data and progress through validation stages.

### Active Phase
Entities in their primary operational state with full functionality and active workflows.

### Archival Phase
Inactive entities are archived to optimize performance while maintaining accessibility for reporting and compliance.

### Purge Phase
Expired or obsolete data is systematically purged according to retention policies and legal requirements.

## Integration Considerations

### External System Sync
Regular synchronization with external systems (insurance providers, parts suppliers, etc.) through API integrations and batch processes.

### Real-Time Notifications
Event-driven architecture for immediate updates to interested parties through webhooks and messaging systems.

### Data Consistency Guarantees
Strong consistency for core business operations with eventual consistency acceptable for reporting and analytics workloads.

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Indexing Strategy
Strategic database indexes on frequently queried fields to optimize common access patterns while minimizing write overhead.

### Caching Layers
Multi-level caching strategy with different TTLs for various data types:
- Hot data (short TTL): Frequently changing information
- Warm data (medium TTL): Moderately changing information
- Cold data (long TTL): Rarely changing reference data

### Query Optimization
Carefully crafted queries that minimize joins and leverage database-specific optimizations while maintaining readability and maintainability.

## Security and Compliance

### Data Encryption
Encryption at rest for sensitive data and encryption in transit for all communications.

### Privacy Controls
Granular privacy controls allowing clients to specify what information can be shared with partners and specialists.

### Audit Logging
Comprehensive audit logging for all data access and modification operations to support compliance requirements.

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Partitioning
Data partitioning strategies that enable horizontal scaling across multiple database instances or clusters.

### Vertical Sharding
Separation of frequently accessed data from archival data to optimize performance for active operations.

### Load Distribution
Intelligent load distribution mechanisms that route requests to appropriate instances based on data locality and current load conditions.
