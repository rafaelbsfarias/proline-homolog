## Overview

The ProLine Hub architecture is organized around several key domains:

1. **Client Management** - Client onboarding, dashboard, and vehicle management
2. **Partner Services** - Partner onboarding, service management, and checklist systems
3. **Vehicle Operations** - Vehicle collection, inspection, and service workflows
4. **Quote Management** - Quotation creation, approval, and service ordering
5. **Admin Functions** - System administration, monitoring, and reporting

Each domain has specific architectural considerations documented in the appropriate sections above.

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design** - Clear separation of concerns between business domains
2. **Microservices Architecture** - Modular, independently deployable services
3. **API-First Development** - Well-defined APIs with versioning strategies
4. **Security by Design** - Built-in authentication, authorization, and data protection
5. **Scalability** - Horizontal scaling capabilities for high availability
6. **Observability** - Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing

## Documentation Standards

All architectural documentation follows these standards:

- **Naming Convention**: kebab-case for all files
- **Structure**: Hierarchical organization by domain and purpose
- **Format**: Markdown with clear headings and consistent formatting
- **Content**: Combination of narrative descriptions, technical specifications, and visual diagrams
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates to reflect current system state

## Contributing

To contribute to the architectural documentation:

1. Follow the established directory structure and naming conventions
2. Use clear, concise language with technical accuracy
3. Include diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts
4. Cross-reference related documentation
5. Update the README when adding new documentation sections

For major architectural changes, create an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) in the reference section.
