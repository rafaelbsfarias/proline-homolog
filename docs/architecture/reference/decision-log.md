# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This document tracks key architectural decisions made during the development of the ProLine Hub system.

## Decision Template

Each architectural decision follows this template:

```
# [Decision Number] - Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
Brief description of the situation that led to this decision.

## Decision
What we decided to do and why.

## Consequences
Positive and negative consequences of this decision.

## Alternatives Considered
Other options that were evaluated.

# 001 - Multi-Tenant Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The ProLine Hub system needs to serve multiple clients (organizations) while maintaining data isolation and enabling potential for white-label deployments.

## Decision
Implement a schema-based multi-tenant architecture where each client organization has its own isolated database schema with shared application logic.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Strong data isolation between clients
- Ability to customize schemas per client if needed
- Easier compliance with data privacy regulations
- Independent backup and recovery per client

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in database management
- Higher resource consumption due to schema multiplication
- More complex migration processes affecting multiple schemas

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Single Database with Tenant ID** - Simpler but weaker data isolation
2. **Separate Database Instances** - Strongest isolation but highest operational overhead
3. **Row-Level Security** - Hybrid approach with application-level tenant filtering

# 002 - Checklist Context Normalization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs to support checklists for vehicles in different contexts (quotes vs. inspections) without duplicating logic or creating tightly coupled relationships.

## Decision
Normalize context as `(context_type, context_id)` where `context_type` is an enum (`quote` | `inspection`) and `context_id` references the appropriate entity.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Unified checklist API and data model for all contexts
- Easy extension to new context types in the future
- Reduced code duplication and maintenance overhead
- Consistent user experience across different workflow types

**Negative:**
- Slightly more complex queries requiring context type checking
- Need for application-level validation of context validity
- Potential confusion for developers unfamiliar with the pattern

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Separate Tables per Context** - Would require duplicate logic and schemas
2. **Polymorphic Foreign Keys** - Database-level complexity with limited ORM support
3. **Direct Foreign Key References** - Tight coupling between checklist and specific context types

# 003 - Partner Category-Based Checklists

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Different types of partners (mechanics, body shops, painters, etc.) require different checklist structures and workflows, but with some common elements.

## Decision
Implement category-specific checklist templates with a mechanism for shared baseline items and category-specific extensions.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Tailored user experiences for different partner types
- Ability to evolve checklists independently for each category
- Clear separation of concerns between different service domains
- Foundation for partner specialization and certification

**Negative:**
- Increased template management complexity
- Need for careful coordination when updating shared items
- Potential for inconsistency if category boundaries are unclear

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Universal Checklist** - Would force all partners into the same mold
2. **Freeform Checklists** - Too flexible, leading to inconsistency
3. **Role-Based Templates** - Similar but less granular than category-based approach

# 004 - Evidence Storage Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Checklist items require supporting evidence (images, videos) that must be stored securely and accessed efficiently while maintaining reasonable costs.

## Decision
Store evidence files in cloud storage (Supabase Storage) with metadata references in the database, using signed URLs for access control and public URLs for presentation.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Cost-effective storage with good performance
- Built-in access control through signed URLs
- Integration with existing authentication infrastructure
- Scalable storage solution

**Negative:**
- Dependency on external storage service
- Need for careful URL expiration management
- Potential latency issues with signed URL generation

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Database Blob Storage** - Would bloat the database and impact performance
2. **Local File System** - Difficult to scale and maintain
3. **Third-Party CDN** - More complex setup with additional costs

---

# 005 - API Versioning Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The API needs to evolve over time while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients and enabling breaking changes when necessary.

## Decision
Implement URL-based versioning with major versions (v1, v2, v3) and maintain backward compatibility within major versions through optional fields and graceful degradation.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear version boundaries for breaking changes
- Easy client migration between versions
- Support for parallel versions during transition periods
- Predictable deprecation timelines

**Negative:**
- URL proliferation with multiple versions
- Need to maintain multiple API implementations
- Potential confusion for clients about which version to use

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Header-Based Versioning** - Less visible and harder to debug
2. **Query Parameter Versioning** - Inconsistent with REST conventions
3. **Media Type Versioning** - Limited tooling support and client adoption

# 006 - Data Model Normalization vs. Denormalization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Balancing between normalized data for integrity and denormalized data for performance in a complex domain with many relationships.

## Decision
Favor normalization for core entities with strategic denormalization for frequently accessed computed fields and summary data.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Strong data integrity through foreign key constraints
- Reduced storage redundancy
- Easier maintenance of business rules
- Flexible querying capabilities

**Negative:**
- More complex queries requiring joins
- Potential performance impact for frequently accessed data
- Need for careful indexing strategy

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Fully Normalized** - Would impact performance unnecessarily
2. **Fully Denormalized** - Would compromise data integrity and increase maintenance burden
3. **Hybrid Approach** - Same decision but with more specific guidelines

# Future Decisions

Additional architectural decisions will be documented as they arise, particularly regarding:
- Microservices decomposition
- Real-time notification mechanisms
- Mobile application architecture
- Reporting and analytics infrastructure
- Internationalization strategy
