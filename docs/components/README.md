## Overview

The ProLine Hub component library follows modern React patterns with a focus on:

1. **Reusability** - Components designed for use across multiple contexts
2. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 compliant with proper ARIA attributes
3. **Consistency** - Unified design language and interaction patterns
4. **Performance** - Optimized rendering and minimal dependencies
5. **Maintainability** - Clear APIs and comprehensive documentation

## Component Categories

### Form Components
Input fields, buttons, selects, checkboxes, and other form elements that capture user data.

### Layout Components
Containers, grids, cards, and other structural elements that organize content.

### Navigation Components
Menus, breadcrumbs, tabs, and other elements that help users move through the application.

### Feedback Components
Modals, toasts, loaders, and other elements that provide feedback to user actions.

### Data Display Components
Tables, lists, charts, and other elements that present information to users.

## Documentation Standards

All component documentation follows these standards:

- **Naming Convention**: kebab-case for all files
- **Structure**: Consistent format with overview, API, usage, and examples
- **Format**: Markdown with clear headings and code examples
- **Content**: Combination of narrative descriptions, technical specifications, and visual examples
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates to reflect current component state

## Contributing

To contribute to the component documentation:

1. Follow the established directory structure and naming conventions
2. Use clear, concise language with technical accuracy
3. Include code examples for all usage scenarios
4. Cross-reference related components and documentation
5. Update the README when adding new component documentation

For major component changes, update both the component implementation and its documentation simultaneously.
